Stride is basically the number of units that you move when you're moving your filter from one location to another. If stride is 1, then the filter will move to the right or down by 1 unit, but when it's 9, then it will move over by 9 units.
padding controls the amount of padding applied to the input. It can be either a string {'valid', 'same'} or a tuple of ints giving the amount of implicit padding applied on both sides. dilation controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the Ã  trous algorithm.
Stride: it defines the step size of the kernel when sliding through the image. Stride of 1 means that the kernel slides through the image pixel by pixel. Stride of 2 means that the kernel slides through image by moving 2 pixels per step (i.e., skipping 1 pixel).
The filters are learned during training (i.e. during backpropagation). Hence, the individual values of the filters are often called the weights of CNN. A neuron is a filter whose weights are learned during training. E.g., a (3,3,3) filter (or neuron) has 27 units.
Increase in size of a convolutional kernel would necessarily increase the performance of a convolutional neural network. Kernel size is a hyperparameter and therefore by changing it we can increase or decrease performance.
Increasing kernel size means effectively increasing the total number of parameters. So, it is expected that the model has a higher complexity to address a given problem. So it should perform better at least for a particular training set.
A common choice is to keep the kernel size at 3x3 or 5x5. The first convolutional layer is often kept larger. Its size is less important as there is only one first layer, and it has fewer input channels: 3, 1 by color.
If the applicant has failed the Learner Licence test, he can take a retest after 7 days from the date of online test. The applicant has to provide some information like application number for last Learner Licence test and cash receipt to take the retest for Learner Licence.
In Andhra Pradesh, a Learner Licence is valid for six months and is renewable for another six months during its validity.
The output is always between 0 and 1, that means that the output after applying sigmoid is always positive hence, during gradient-descent, the gradient on the weights during backpropagation will always be either positive or negative depending on the output of the neuron.
The major drawback of the sigmoid activation function is to create a vanishing gradient problem. This is the Non zero Centered Activation Function. The model Learning rate is slow. Create a Vanishing gradient problem.
Non-differentiable at zero and ReLU is unbounded. The gradients for negative input are zero, which means for activations in that region, the weights are not updated during backpropagation. This can create dead neurons that never get activated.
Batch processing handles large amounts of non-continuous data. It can process data quickly, minimize or eliminate the need for user interaction, and improve the efficiency of job processing. It can be ideal for managing database updates, transaction processing, and converting files from one format to another.
The computer operators should be well known with batch systems. Batch systems are hard to debug. It is sometimes costly. The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails.
For smaller manufacturers batch processing generally makes most sense. A batch process can be started and stopped relatively easily. Although, a disadvantage is that you have to keep on cleaning/starting up between every batch. That said, overall risk with a batch process can be lower as well.
A learning rate that is too large can cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, whereas a learning rate that is too small can cause the process to get stuck. The challenge of training deep learning neural networks involves carefully selecting the learning rate.
What if we use a learning rate that's too large? Option B is correct because the error rate would become erratic and explode.
Generally, a large learning rate allows the model to learn faster, at the cost of arriving on a sub-optimal final set of weights. A smaller learning rate may allow the model to learn a more optimal or even globally optimal set of weights but may take significantly longer to train.

If your learning rate is set too low, training will progress very slowly as you are making very tiny updates to the weights in your network. However, if your learning rate is set too high, it can cause undesirable divergent behavior in your loss function.
We provide another novel explanation of learning rate decay: an initially large learning rate suppresses the network from memorizing noisy data while decaying the learning rate improves the learning of complex patterns.
A convolution is the simple application of a filter to an input that results in an activation. Repeated application of the same filter to an input results in a map of activations called a feature map, indicating the locations and strength of a detected feature in an input, such as an image.
Naturally, CNN is designed to learn classification method based on shape information, but we proved that CNN can also learn classification based on color distribution. In our method, we convert the input image to two different color spaces, HSV and CIE Lab, and run it to some CNN architecture.
A convolution converts all the pixels in its receptive field into a single value. For example, if you would apply a convolution to an image, you will be decreasing the image size as well as bringing all the information in the field together into a single pixel. The final output of the convolutional layer is a vector.
